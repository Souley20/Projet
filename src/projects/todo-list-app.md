The todo list application project is a software tool designed to help individuals and teams manage their daily tasks and responsibilities. This project aims to solve the problem of disorganization and inefficiency by providing users with a user-friendly interface to create, edit, and prioritize tasks.

### Technologies Used
The technologies used in this project include React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage. The application also uses authentication and authorization to ensure data privacy and security.

### Challenges and Lessons Learned
One of the main challenges faced during this project was designing the user interface to be both functional and aesthetically pleasing. I had to take into the needs of the users and make sure that the application was easy to navigate and use.

Another challenge was implementing features such as reminders and notifications. I had to ensure that users would receive timely reminders about their tasks without overwhelming them with too many notifications.

Throughout the project, I learnt valuable lessons about my ability to produce code, research and project management. I learnt the importance of setting clear objectives and deadlines and imagining collaborative working for my future career.

Overall, the task list application project was a valuable learning experience that allowed me to develop technical and interpersonal skills and create a useful tool for individuals looking to stay organised and productive.
